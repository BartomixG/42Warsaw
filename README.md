# 42Warsaw
This repository contains my completed projects from the **42 curriculum** (C projects first), plus additional projects I may add later (e.g., Python).  
Each project lives in its own directory with its own build/run instructions and notes.

> ⚠️ **Academic integrity:** This repo is public for learning and portfolio purposes. If you’re currently doing 42 projects, use it responsibly—avoid copy/paste and focus on understanding.
